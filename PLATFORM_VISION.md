## 1. Executive Product Vision

### 1.1 The Defining Statement

**CosmittoHUB is the world's first AI-native, context-aware enterprise operations platform** that unifies service management, internal operations, knowledge intelligence, and team coordination into a single, deeply integrated workspace — where every workflow is augmented by AI that understands organizational context, not just keywords.

The platform is not a helpdesk with AI bolted on. It is an **operations intelligence layer** that happens to have a ticket surface. The distinction is fundamental.

### 1.2 The Problem We Solve — Precisely

Current enterprise platforms suffer from three structural failures:

**Structural Failure #1 — Context Blindness**  
ServiceNow knows a ticket's status. It does not know that the reporter submitted 4 tickets in the last 48 hours, is a VIP customer whose contract renews next month, and that the assigned agent resolved an identical issue 3 months ago but never documented the fix. CosmittoHUB makes this context ambient, automatic, and actionable.

**Structural Failure #2 — Workflow Rigidity**  
Jira forces teams into its data model. Teams adapt their operations to fit the tool, not the inverse. CosmittoHUB introduces **Adaptive Workflow Graphs** — AI-inferred process flows that model themselves around how teams actually work, detected from behavioral patterns in the data.

**Structural Failure #3 — Intelligence Fragmentation**  
Most platforms offer dashboards. Dashboards are backward-looking. CosmittoHUB offers **Operational Foresight** — a predictive intelligence layer that surfaces risk, predicts SLA breaches 2–4 hours before they occur, forecasts ticket volume spikes, and recommends staffing adjustments in real time.

### 1.3 The Strategic Thesis

The enterprise software market is undergoing a once-per-decade structural shift. The shift is not "add AI to existing tools." The shift is:

> **The organizational operating system is moving from process-centric to intelligence-centric.**

Teams that adopt intelligence-centric platforms will reduce operational overhead by 40–60%, improve resolution quality by 2–3x, and retain institutional knowledge across employee turnover. CosmittoHUB is purpose-built for this transition.

### 1.4 Product Positioning — One Sentence

*"CosmittoHUB is the platform where enterprise operations become intelligent — every ticket resolved faster, every agent empowered, every decision data-driven, and every process continuously optimized by AI that understands your organization."*

## 2. Market Positioning & Competitive Intelligence

### 2.1 Competitive Landscape Analysis

| Platform | Core Strength | Critical Weakness | CosmittoHUB Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ServiceNow** | Enterprise workflow depth, ITSM maturity | $200K+ implementation costs, 18-month deployment, UI from 2015 | 10x faster deployment, modern AI-native UX, 1/5 the cost |
| **Jira Service Management** | Developer ecosystem, Atlassian integration | Requires Atlassian buy-in, poor non-technical UX, fragmented | Unified workspace, business-user-first design |
| **Zendesk Enterprise** | CX-focused, email-first workflows | Weak internal ops, no ITSM depth, expensive at scale | Full ITSM + CX unified, superior AI resolution |
| **Freshservice** | Mid-market ITSM, affordable | Surface-level AI, weak analytics, generic workflows | Deeper AI, predictive ops, 3x analytics depth |
| **Linear** | Developer-focused, beautiful UX | Not enterprise, no service management, niche | CosmittoHUB's design language at enterprise scale |
| **Notion** | Flexible knowledge base | No workflow engine, no SLA, not ops-grade | Combines Notion's flexibility with ops-grade reliability |

### 2.2 The Whitespace We Own

CosmittoHUB targets the **SME-to-Enterprise segment** (50–5,000 employees) that:
- Has outgrown email-and-spreadsheet operations
- Cannot afford ServiceNow's implementation complexity
- Needs more depth than Freshservice provides
- Wants AI that actually works, not demo-ware

This segment represents **$18B TAM** with <15% penetration by modern, AI-native solutions.

### 2.3 Differentiation Pillars (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Context Intelligence** — AI with organizational memory, not just ticket history
2. **Zero-Config Automation** — Workflows that self-configure from behavior observation
3. **Sub-60-Minute Deployment** — Production-ready without a consultant
4. **Design Premium** — The most visually sophisticated enterprise tool in the category
5. **Transparent AI** — Every AI decision is explainable; no black boxes

---

## 3. Core Product Philosophy

### 3.1 The Five Design Axioms

**Axiom 1 — Calm Technology**  
The platform should reduce cognitive load, not add to it. Every notification must justify its existence. Every action must have a clear consequence. Information density must be high but never overwhelming. CosmittoHUB should feel like a calm, intelligent colleague — not an alarm system.

**Axiom 2 — Progressive Disclosure**  
A new agent on day one and a power user after two years must both feel at home. The interface reveals complexity on demand. Simple by default, powerful by choice.

**Axiom 3 — AI as Infrastructure, Not Feature**  
AI is not a tab in the nav. AI is not a chatbot in the corner. AI is the operational layer that makes every feature smarter — drafting replies, routing tickets, predicting delays, surfacing context, detecting patterns. When AI is doing its job, users shouldn't notice it — they just notice that work feels effortless.

**Axiom 4 — Data Sovereignty**  
Enterprise customers own their data unconditionally. The platform provides self-hosted, private cloud, and SaaS deployment options. Zero vendor lock-in. Full data portability at any time with one-click export.

**Axiom 5 — Speed as a Feature**  
Every interaction under 100ms. Every page load under 800ms on a standard connection. Performance is not a metric to be chased — it is a product requirement as important as any feature.

### 3.2 The User Archetypes

**The Operations Director** — Needs executive visibility, trend analysis, capacity planning, and board-ready reports. Uses the platform 30 minutes/day maximum. Every second of their time is precious.

**The Senior Agent** — Needs frictionless ticket handling, AI-assisted drafting, contextual knowledge retrieval, and smart prioritization. Processes 40–80 tickets/day. Speed and keyboard-first navigation are critical.

**The Department Head** — Needs team workload visibility, SLA performance, escalation management, and staffing insight. Reviews dashboards and approves escalations.

**The End User** — Submits tickets, tracks status, and rates resolutions. Must be able to do all of this in under 2 minutes without training. Mobile-first experience is essential.

**The System Administrator** — Configures workflows, manages permissions, maintains integrations, and monitors system health. Needs surgical control without requiring a developer.

## 4. AI-Native Architecture Layer

### 4.1 The CosmittoAI Engine — Core Components

The AI layer is not a single model. It is a **coordinated intelligence mesh** of specialized models operating on different time horizons and data domains.

```

### 4.2 Triage AI — Intelligent Ticket Routing

**What it does**: Analyzes incoming tickets and makes 8 simultaneous classifications within 200ms of submission.

**Classification dimensions**:
1. **Category** — ITSM category tree (5-level taxonomy, auto-learned per org)
2. **Priority** — Impact × Urgency matrix computed from ticket content + historical patterns
3. **Assigned Agent** — Best-fit agent based on: expertise match, current workload, past resolution rate on similar tickets, time-zone availability
4. **Estimated Resolution Time** — Regression model trained on 18 months of org-specific data
5. **SLA Risk** — Probability of breach given current queue state
6. **Sentiment** — Reporter emotional state (frustrated, urgent, calm) for agent preparation
7. **Duplicate Detection** — Semantic similarity match against open tickets (>0.85 cosine similarity triggers merge suggestion)
8. **Escalation Probability** — Likelihood this ticket will require escalation within 24h

**Technical Implementation**:
- Fine-tuned `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` for semantic embedding
- Custom classification head trained per organization after 500 resolved tickets
- Online learning: model updates nightly with last 24h resolutions
- Fallback: rule-based routing when confidence < 0.72
- Explanation layer: every decision includes a `reasoning` field exposed in the agent UI

### 4.3 Draft AI — Contextual Response Generation

**What it does**: Generates complete, contextually appropriate ticket responses in the agent's voice.

**Not a generic LLM wrapper**. The Draft AI is:
- Trained on the organization's historical responses (style transfer)
- Injected with: ticket context, reporter profile, related KB articles, past interactions with same reporter, current system status, agent's typical phrasing patterns
- Aware of tone requirements: technical precision for IT tickets, empathetic tone for HR tickets, formal language for compliance tickets
- Multi-language: detects ticket language and drafts in-kind (French, English, Arabic, + 40 others)

**Prompt Architecture** (per response generation):
```
SYSTEM: You are a support agent at {org_name}. 
Organizational tone: {tone_profile}.
Agent style profile: {agent_voice_embedding}.
Resolution history with this reporter: {interaction_summary}.

CONTEXT:
- Ticket: {ticket_content}
- Reporter: {reporter_profile} (VIP: {is_vip}, Tenure: {tenure})
- Related resolutions: {semantic_top_3_similar}
- KB articles: {relevant_articles}
- Current system status: {status_page_snapshot}

CONSTRAINTS:
- Maximum 3 paragraphs unless technical steps required
- Include ticket reference #{ticket_id}
- Offer follow-up if confidence in resolution < 0.8
- Language: {detected_language}

TASK: Draft a complete response.
```

**Agent Experience**:
- Draft appears in a dedicated panel, never overwrites agent's own text
- Agents can accept whole draft, accept paragraph-by-paragraph, or dismiss
- Every acceptance/modification trains the style model
- Draft confidence score shown (e.g., "85% confident this resolves the issue")

### 4.4 Forecast AI — Operational Foresight

**What it does**: Predicts operational conditions up to 72 hours in advance.

**Predictions produced every 15 minutes**:

| Prediction | Horizon | Model Type | Trigger Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ticket volume by category | 4h, 24h, 72h | LSTM time-series | Staffing recommendation |
| SLA breach probability per open ticket | Rolling 2h | Gradient Boost + survival analysis | Proactive escalation |
| Agent burnout risk | 48h | Multi-variate regression | Workload rebalancing |
| System incident correlation | 1h | Pattern matching + anomaly detection | Preemptive KB deployment |
| Customer churn signal | 7 days | Classification on interaction quality | Customer success alert |

**SLA Breach Prediction Detail**:
- Trains on: historical resolution time distribution per category/priority/agent/day-of-week/time-of-day
- Inputs: current ticket age, category, assigned agent's current queue, agent's historical performance on this category, open blocker tickets, escalation history of this reporter
- Output: `P(breach)` with confidence interval, plus `recommended_action` enum: `[reassign, escalate, extend_sla, notify_reporter, none]`
- Alert fires when P(breach) > 0.65 AND ticket is at >60% of SLA window

### 4.5 Context Graph AI — Organizational Memory

**The most differentiating capability.**

**What it builds**: A live knowledge graph of the organization's operational reality.

```
Nodes: Tickets, Users, Systems, Departments, Issues, Resolutions, KB Articles, Agents, Assets
Edges: resolved_by, related_to, caused_by, reported_by, assigned_to, blocks, duplicates, mentions, affects
Properties: timestamps, confidence scores, recency weights
```

**What it enables**:
- When a new ticket is submitted: "3 similar tickets were opened today, all related to the VPN gateway update deployed at 14:30. Likely root cause: firewall rule regression. Suggested resolution: linked."
- When an agent opens a ticket: full context panel showing reporter's entire history, open related tickets, relevant KB articles, and similar past resolutions — without the agent searching for anything
- When a manager reviews the queue: cluster visualization showing 12 tickets that are actually one incident, currently being treated as 12 separate issues

**Storage**: Neo4j graph database with 6-month rolling window + archived cold storage. Vector embeddings stored in Qdrant for semantic search. Event stream from Apache Kafka for real-time graph updates.

### 4.6 Coach AI — Agent Performance Optimization

**What it does**: Provides personalized, actionable coaching to agents — not generic training, but specific improvement recommendations based on their actual performance data.

**Coaching dimensions**:
- "You resolve Network tickets 40% slower than your category average. The top 3 agents on your team use KB article #847 for this ticket type — you've never accessed it."
- "Your first-response time is excellent (top 10%) but your CSAT on escalated tickets is 2.1/5. Your responses on escalations are 2.3x longer than high-rated peers. Consider brevity."
- "You've had 4 SLA breaches this month, all on Friday afternoons. Check if your Friday queue needs redistribution."

**Delivery**: Weekly digest email + in-app coaching panel + real-time micro-tips ("This ticket type typically needs a follow-up in 2h to maintain CSAT")

---

## 5. Technical Architecture Blueprint

### 5.1 Architecture Philosophy

**Current State**: Monolithic Flask application — single process, synchronous request handling, single database.

**Target State**: **Event-Driven Modular Monolith** evolving to **Selective Microservices** — not a premature distributed system, but a thoughtfully decomposed architecture where boundaries are drawn on data ownership and scaling requirements, not on organizational convenience.

The decomposition strategy follows the **Strangler Fig pattern**: the monolith is progressively hollowed out as services are extracted, with no big-bang rewrite.

### 5.3 Service Decomposition — Ownership Boundaries

Each service owns its data. No service directly queries another service's database. All cross-service communication is via events (async) or gRPC (sync, latency-critical paths).

**Ticket Service** — owns: tickets, tasks, comments, attachments, history, SLA records  
**User Service** — owns: users, roles, permissions, teams, auth tokens, sessions  
**Department Service** — owns: departments, categories, workflows, SLA configurations  
**AI Service** — owns: ML model registry, inference jobs, training pipelines, prediction records  
**Search Service** — owns: search indices (Typesense), no persistent state  
**Notification Service** — owns: notification queue, delivery records, preferences  
**Reporting Service** — owns: aggregated metrics, report definitions, export jobs (reads from ClickHouse)  
**Knowledge Service** — owns: KB articles, templates, tags, search embeddings  
**Audit Service** — owns: immutable audit log (append-only), compliance records  
**Integration Service** — owns: webhook definitions, OAuth tokens, integration configs

## 6. Data Architecture & Storage Strategy

### 6.1 Event Sourcing for Audit-Grade History

Every state change in the system produces an immutable event. The current state of any entity is always computable from its event stream.

```python
# Example: Ticket Event Schema
class TicketEvent(BaseModel):
    event_id: UUID          # Globally unique
    event_type: TicketEventType  # CREATED | UPDATED | ASSIGNED | COMMENTED | RESOLVED | ...
    aggregate_id: UUID      # Ticket ID
    aggregate_version: int  # Monotonically increasing — optimistic concurrency
    tenant_id: UUID         # Multi-tenancy boundary
    actor_id: UUID          # Who triggered this
    actor_role: str
    occurred_at: datetime   # UTC, microsecond precision
    payload: dict           # Event-specific data
    metadata: dict          # Correlation ID, causation ID, IP, user agent
    checksum: str           # SHA-256 of event body — tamper detection
```

This architecture provides:
- Complete audit trail without needing a separate audit log table
- Time-travel queries: reconstruct ticket state at any point in history
- Event replay for building new projections without data migration
- Compliance-grade immutability (events are never deleted, only tombstoned)

### 6.2 CQRS — Separate Read and Write Models

Write model (Command side) → Normalized PostgreSQL for consistency  
Read model (Query side) → Denormalized projections for performance

The ticket list view, agent dashboard, and manager reports each have dedicated, pre-computed read models updated by event consumers. A manager requesting a department report queries a ClickHouse projection that is pre-aggregated, not a JOIN-heavy query on the primary database.

### 6.3 Multi-Tenant Data Isolation Strategy

Three isolation models, selectable per customer contract:

**Shared Schema** (Standard/Growth tiers)  
- Single database, `tenant_id` column on every table
- Row-level security policies in PostgreSQL
- Logical separation, highest efficiency
- Acceptable for: <10,000 tickets/month/tenant

**Schema-Per-Tenant** (Professional tier)  
- Single database server, dedicated schema per tenant
- Complete data isolation at schema level
- Migration and backup granularity per tenant
- Acceptable for: 10,000–500,000 tickets/month/tenant

**Database-Per-Tenant** (Enterprise tier)  
- Dedicated PostgreSQL instance per tenant (or tenant cluster)
- Hardware-level isolation, dedicated connection pool
- Custom backup retention, point-in-time recovery
- Required for: SOC 2 Type II compliance, HIPAA, regulated industries

### 6.4 Data Retention & Lifecycle

```
ACTIVE (0-6 months):      Hot storage — PostgreSQL primary, Redis cache
WARM (6-24 months):       Warm storage — PostgreSQL with partitioning, reduced cache TTL  
COLD (24-60 months):      Cold storage — ClickHouse columnar + S3 parquet export
ARCHIVE (60+ months):     Glacier-tier S3 — compliance hold, read-only API access
```

Automated lifecycle policies via Apache Airflow, with tenant-configurable retention overrides (subject to compliance floor minimums).

## 7. Multi-Tenant Infrastructure Design

### 7.1 Tenant Onboarding Pipeline

New tenant signup triggers an automated provisioning pipeline:

```
1. Tenant record created (< 100ms)
2. Database schema/instance provisioned (< 30 seconds)
3. Default roles, permissions, categories seeded (< 5 seconds)
4. Search indices created in Typesense (< 10 seconds)
5. AI model initialized with org profile (async, < 2 minutes)
6. Welcome email + setup wizard link sent (< 1 minute)
7. DNS subdomain {tenant}.cosmittohub.com activated (< 60 seconds)

Total: First login possible in < 3 minutes from signup.
```

### 7.2 Kubernetes Deployment Architecture

```yaml
# Resource allocation per deployment tier
tiers:
  starter:
    replicas: 1
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"
    database: shared-pool
    
  growth:
    replicas: 2
    cpu: "1000m"
    memory: "1Gi"
    database: shared-pool-premium
    
  professional:
    replicas: 3
    cpu: "2000m"
    memory: "2Gi"
    database: schema-isolated
    
  enterprise:
    replicas: "auto (3-20)"
    cpu: "4000m-16000m"
    memory: "4Gi-32Gi"
    database: dedicated-cluster
    horizontal_pod_autoscaling: true
    custom_domain: true
    private_networking: optional
```

### 7.3 Global Availability Architecture

Three deployment regions (Phase 2):
- **EU-West** (Paris / Frankfurt) — primary for European customers, GDPR-resident data
- **US-East** (Virginia) — primary for North American customers
- **MENA** (Bahrain) — primary for Middle East / North Africa customers

Data residency guarantees: customer data never leaves the selected region without explicit consent.

Active-Active configuration with:
- Global load balancing (Cloudflare) with latency-based routing
- Cross-region read replicas for disaster recovery
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective): < 15 minutes
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective): < 1 minute (streaming replication)

## 8. Feature Specification — Exhaustive

### 8.1 Ticket Workspace — Redesigned

#### 8.1.1 The Ticket Detail Page

The ticket detail page is the most used surface in the product. It must be the fastest, most information-dense, and most actionable screen in the platform.

**Layout**: Three-column layout on desktop (1440px+)
- **Column 1 (35%)** — Ticket content: title, description, thread (chronological), AI-suggested actions
- **Column 2 (40%)** — Activity feed: comments, internal notes, history events, time tracking
- **Column 3 (25%)** — Context panel: reporter profile, related tickets, linked assets, AI insights, SLA countdown

**SLA Countdown**: Not a simple timer. It's a pressure indicator — green/amber/red based on probability of breach, not just remaining time. Accounts for agent's current queue and historical resolution speed.

**AI Context Panel** — always visible on ticket detail:
```
📋 Similar Resolutions (3 found, 92% relevance)
🔍 Root Cause Hypothesis: "Likely caused by VPN gateway update deployed 2h ago"
👤 Reporter Context: "5th ticket this month. Previous 4 resolved in <2h. CSAT: 4.8/5"
⚡ Suggested Response: "Draft ready — 89% confidence"
🔗 Related Open Tickets: 4 tickets from same department, same category
```

#### 8.1.2 Bulk Operations Engine

Agents handle 40–80 tickets/day. Bulk operations are not a convenience — they are a productivity multiplier.

**Bulk actions available**:
- Reassign (single agent or round-robin across team)
- Change status (with optional bulk note)
- Apply macro (predefined multi-step action sequence)
- Merge duplicates (AI-detected or manually selected)
- Set priority
- Add tag / remove tag
- Export selection to CSV/PDF
- Schedule follow-up
- Apply SLA policy override

**Selection model**: Shift-click ranges, Ctrl+click individual, keyboard-native (j/k navigation, x to select)

#### 8.1.3 Linked Ticket Graph View

For complex incidents where 10+ tickets share a root cause, a force-directed graph visualization replaces the flat list. Nodes are tickets, edges are relationships (duplicates, related, caused by). Clicking a node expands it inline. Collapsing the graph resolves all linked tickets with a single action.

### 8.2 Workflow Engine — Adaptive Process Automation

#### 8.2.1 Visual Workflow Builder

A canvas-based, node-and-edge workflow designer. No code required. Comparable to n8n or Zapier but purpose-built for service operations.

**Node types**:
- **Trigger nodes**: ticket created, status changed, SLA threshold crossed, comment added, field changed, scheduled time, webhook received
- **Condition nodes**: field value check, reporter attribute, time window, AI score threshold, workload check
- **Action nodes**: assign agent, send notification, update field, create sub-task, call webhook, post to Slack/Teams, generate AI draft, escalate, create linked ticket, send email
- **AI nodes**: run triage, generate summary, classify intent, check for duplicates, compute priority
- **Delay nodes**: wait N minutes/hours/business-days, wait until date, wait for condition

**Example workflow**: "VIP Escalation Protocol"
```
TRIGGER: Ticket created
  ↓
CONDITION: Is reporter VIP tier?
  → YES ↓
CONDITION: Priority >= High?
  → YES ↓
ACTION: Assign to Senior Agent Pool
ACTION: Set SLA to "VIP" policy (50% reduced timers)
ACTION: Notify Department Head via Slack
ACTION: Generate AI draft response immediately
DELAY: 15 minutes
CONDITION: Ticket still unacknowledged?
  → YES ↓
ACTION: Escalate to Manager
ACTION: Send SMS alert (via Twilio)
```

#### 8.2.2 Macro Engine

Macros are one-click multi-step action sequences. Unlike workflows (which are event-driven), macros are agent-initiated.

**Macro structure**:
```json
{
  "name": "Known Issue — Password Reset",
  "conditions": {
    "category": ["Authentication", "Account Access"],
    "keywords": ["password", "reset", "locked", "cannot login"]
  },
  "actions": [
    {"type": "set_status", "value": "resolved"},
    {"type": "apply_template", "template_id": "password_reset_guide"},
    {"type": "add_tag", "value": "self-service-candidate"},
    {"type": "update_kb_stat", "article_id": "kb_0042"}
  ],
  "confidence_threshold": 0.8  // Only suggest macro when AI confidence >= 80%
}
```

AI automatically surfaces the most relevant macro for each ticket (top 3 suggestions, ranked by historical effectiveness for this ticket's category and keywords).

### 8.3 Knowledge Intelligence Layer

#### 8.3.1 AI-Powered Knowledge Base

Not a static wiki. A living, intelligence-augmented knowledge system.

**Creation**: Agents can convert any resolved ticket into a KB article with one click. AI:
- Extracts the solution steps from the resolution comment
- Generates a structured article (symptoms → diagnosis → resolution → prevention)
- Suggests categories and tags
- Flags if a similar article already exists (preventing duplication)
- Estimates article quality score (completeness, clarity, actionability)

**Search**: Semantic search — not keyword matching. "How do I get into my email when I'm traveling?" finds "Remote email access configuration" even with zero keyword overlap.

**Usage Intelligence**:
- Article view count, resolution application rate (was it actually used to resolve a ticket?)
- Agent feedback ratings (1-5 stars with mandatory comment on <3)
- Outdated detection: articles not accessed in 90 days + related tickets still being opened = "Article may be outdated" flag
- Gap detection: category of tickets with low KB utilization = "Knowledge gap detected" alert to KB manager

#### 8.3.2 Contextual Knowledge Surfacing

Knowledge never requires agents to search manually. The system surfaces it:
- When an agent opens a ticket: top 3 relevant articles in the context panel
- When an agent starts typing a response: inline KB suggestions appear (like IDE autocomplete)
- When a reporter submits a ticket: self-service KB deflection shown before submission confirmation ("These articles might solve your issue immediately")

**Deflection measurement**: Track how many reporter-facing KB suggestions result in ticket not being submitted. This is a core product metric — reducing support volume while maintaining customer satisfaction.

### 8.4 Analytics & Business Intelligence

#### 8.4.1 Executive Dashboard

Real-time, streaming metrics. Not cached hourly — updated every 30 seconds via SSE.

**KPI cards** (primary row):
- Total open tickets (with delta vs. last 7 days)
- SLA compliance rate (current period, with trend sparkline)
- Average first response time (vs. SLA target, vs. last period)
- Average resolution time (vs. SLA target, vs. last period)
- CSAT score (current week, with distribution histogram)
- Agent utilization rate (team-level and per-agent)

**Operational health matrix** (secondary row):
- Ticket volume heatmap (hour × day-of-week, last 4 weeks)
- Category distribution donut with drill-down
- Priority distribution waterfall
- Escalation rate trend
- AI automation rate (% of tickets with AI-assisted actions)

**Forecast panel** (tertiary row):
- Next 24h volume prediction (with 90% confidence interval)
- Staffing recommendation ("You need 2 additional agents between 14:00-17:00 tomorrow")
- Top predicted SLA risks for open tickets

#### 8.4.2 Report Builder

Self-service report creation with no SQL required.

**Report components**:
- **Metrics**: Any tracked metric with aggregation (sum, avg, p50, p95, p99, count, ratio)
- **Dimensions**: Any attribute (agent, department, category, priority, tag, custom field)
- **Filters**: Any field with comparison operators, date ranges, relative periods
- **Visualizations**: Line, bar, stacked bar, pie, donut, heatmap, scatter, table, KPI card
- **Grouping**: Up to 3 dimensions simultaneously
- **Time granularity**: Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly

**Saved reports**: Shareable URLs, scheduled delivery (PDF/Excel/CSV) to email recipients, dashboard pinning.

**AI-assisted analysis**: "Explain this chart" button — Claude generates a 2-paragraph natural language interpretation of any visualization, highlighting anomalies and trends.

### 8.5 Asset Management (CMDB-Lite)

Every enterprise operation tool needs to know what assets exist. CosmittoHUB includes a lightweight CMDB (Configuration Management Database) that keeps assets in context without the complexity of a full ServiceNow CMDB.

**Asset types**: Hardware (laptops, servers, printers, phones), Software (licenses, SaaS subscriptions), Services (internal and external), Infrastructure (network equipment, access points).

**Auto-discovery**: Agent-installed lightweight collector (< 5MB) reports asset inventory and health every 15 minutes. Agentless discovery via network scan for infrastructure assets.

**Ticket-Asset linking**: When a ticket is submitted, CosmittoHUB attempts to link it to a specific asset ("My laptop won't connect" → automatically linked to the reporter's registered laptop). SLA and priority can be modified based on asset criticality.

### 8.6 Field Service & On-Site Operations

For organizations with physical presence and field technicians:

**Technician Mobile App** (PWA, iOS + Android):
- Offline-capable (IndexedDB sync when connectivity restored)
- GPS-enabled: ticket assignment based on proximity
- QR code scanning for asset identification
- Photo attachment directly from camera
- Voice-to-text for rapid note entry
- Digital signature capture for service completion
- Route optimization when multiple site visits scheduled

**Dispatch Board**: Map view of open field tickets with technician locations. Drag-and-drop reassignment. ETA calculation based on distance and traffic.

### 8.7 Customer Portal (Self-Service Layer)

Branded, customizable customer-facing portal:

**End user capabilities**:
- Submit tickets with guided intake forms (category-specific forms, reducing back-and-forth)
- Real-time ticket status tracking with timeline visualization
- Chat-based ticket interaction (not just email thread view)
- KB search and article reading
- CSAT rating after resolution
- Scheduled callback request
- Service catalog browsing (request standard services from a catalog, not free-text tickets)

**Service Catalog**: IT can publish standardized service requests (New Employee Onboarding, Software License Request, VPN Access) with approval workflows, estimated fulfillment times, and pricing (for charge-back scenarios). Requesters select from a clean product-catalog-style UI.

## 9. Design System & UX Philosophy

### 9.1 The Cosmitto Design Language — "Structured Depth"

The visual language communicates: **precision, intelligence, and calm confidence**. It borrows from premium product design — the restraint of Linear, the information density of Vercel's dashboard, the brand confidence of Stripe, and the depth of Notion — but synthesized into something distinctly Cosmitto.

### 9.2 Color System — Extended Semantic Palette

**Core Brand**:
```css
--cosmitto-void: #080B10;         /* Darkest bg - dark mode base */
--cosmitto-ink: #0F172A;          /* Dark mode surface */
--cosmitto-graphite: #1E293B;     /* Dark mode card bg */
--cosmitto-slate: #334155;        /* Dark mode border */
--cosmitto-mist: #94A3B8;         /* Secondary text */
--cosmitto-cloud: #CBD5E1;        /* Primary text - dark mode */
--cosmitto-white: #F8FAFC;        /* Light mode primary bg */

--cosmitto-red: #DC2626;          /* Brand red - primary action */
--cosmitto-red-light: #FEF2F2;    /* Red tint bg */
--cosmitto-red-dark: #991B1B;     /* Red hover/active */

--cosmitto-amber: #F59E0B;        /* Warning / high priority */
--cosmitto-amber-light: #FFFBEB;
--cosmitto-amber-dark: #B45309;

--cosmitto-navy: #0F172A;         /* Brand navy */
--cosmitto-navy-mid: #1E3A5F;     /* Interactive navy */
```

**Status Semantic Colors** (consistent across all surfaces):
```css
--status-new: #6366F1;            /* Indigo - new/unread */
--status-in-progress: #0EA5E9;    /* Sky blue - active */
--status-waiting: #F59E0B;        /* Amber - pending external */
--status-resolved: #10B981;       /* Emerald - success */
--status-closed: #6B7280;         /* Gray - terminal */
--status-cancelled: #EF4444;      /* Red - cancelled */

--priority-critical: #DC2626;     /* Red */
--priority-urgent: #F97316;       /* Orange */
--priority-high: #F59E0B;         /* Amber */
--priority-medium: #3B82F6;       /* Blue */
--priority-low: #6B7280;          /* Gray */
```

### 9.3 Typography System

```css
/* Display — hero headings, dashboard KPI numbers */
--font-display: 'Staatliches', system-ui;
--font-size-display-xl: clamp(3rem, 6vw, 7rem);
--font-size-display-lg: clamp(2rem, 4vw, 4rem);

/* Interface — all UI text */
--font-interface: 'IBM Plex Sans', -apple-system, sans-serif;

/* Mono — code, IDs, technical values */
--font-mono: 'IBM Plex Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace;

/* Scale (fluid, clamp-based) */
--text-xs: clamp(0.6875rem, 1.1vw, 0.75rem);
--text-sm: clamp(0.8125rem, 1.3vw, 0.875rem);
--text-base: clamp(0.9375rem, 1.5vw, 1rem);
--text-lg: clamp(1.0625rem, 1.7vw, 1.125rem);
--text-xl: clamp(1.1875rem, 1.9vw, 1.25rem);
--text-2xl: clamp(1.4375rem, 2.3vw, 1.5rem);
```

### 9.4 Spacing & Grid System

8px base unit, 4px half-unit for tight density.

```css
--space-1: 4px;
--space-2: 8px;
--space-3: 12px;
--space-4: 16px;
--space-5: 20px;
--space-6: 24px;
--space-8: 32px;
--space-10: 40px;
--space-12: 48px;
--space-16: 64px;
--space-20: 80px;
--space-24: 96px;
```

Layout grid: 12-column, 24px gutter, responsive breakpoints:
- `sm`: 640px, `md`: 768px, `lg`: 1024px, `xl`: 1280px, `2xl`: 1536px

### 9.5 Component Architecture — Design System Inventory

**Foundation Components** (atomic):
Badge, Button (9 variants), Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Radio, Toggle, Slider, Calendar, ColorPicker, Icon (384 custom icons), Avatar, Spinner, Skeleton, Divider, Tooltip, Popover, Sheet, Dialog, Drawer, Toast, Alert

**Composite Components** (molecular):
TicketCard, AgentCard, DepartmentCard, KPICard, ActivityItem, CommentBlock, NotificationItem, SearchResult, FilterChip, SortControl, Pagination, DataTable (virtualized, 10K+ rows), Timeline, Kanban card, GraphNode

**Page-Level Components** (organisms):
TicketDetailPanel, AIContextSidebar, AgentWorkspace, ManagerDashboard, ReportCanvas, WorkflowBuilder, KBEditor, NotificationCenter, GlobalSearch, CommandPalette

### 9.6 Motion Design Principles

All animations serve a purpose: they communicate state change, guide attention, or provide physical metaphor for actions.

**Motion vocabulary**:
- **Appear/Disappear**: opacity + scale (0.96→1.0), 150ms ease-out
- **Slide in/out**: translateX/Y, 200ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)
- **Expand/Collapse**: height animation with spring physics
- **Success feedback**: checkmark draw animation, 300ms
- **Loading**: skeleton with CSS gradient shimmer, no spinners unless operation > 2s
- **AI generating**: typewriter-style text reveal for AI-drafted content

**Performance constraint**: No animation > 300ms on the critical path. All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### 9.7 Command Palette — The Power User Gateway

`⌘K` (Mac) / `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) opens the universal command palette.

**Capabilities**:
- Navigate to any page (fuzzy search)
- Open any ticket by ID or keyword
- Assign current ticket to agent
- Change ticket status
- Apply macro
- Run bulk action on selected tickets
- Create new ticket / user / department
- Open any KB article
- Run any report
- Toggle theme
- Show keyboard shortcuts

Search is fully semantic — "show me unresolved VPN tickets from last week assigned to nobody" works as a natural language query, returning filtered results.

---

## 10. Integration Ecosystem & API Strategy

### 10.1 REST API v2 — Design Principles

**Versioning**: URI-based (`/api/v2/`) with 18-month deprecation lifecycle  
**Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 + API Keys (scoped, rotatable, with usage analytics)  
**Rate limiting**: Tier-based, per-endpoint, with burst allowance  
**Pagination**: Cursor-based (not offset) for stable, efficient large-dataset traversal  
**Filtering**: OData-inspired filter syntax: `?filter=status eq 'open' and priority gte 3`  
**Field selection**: Sparse fieldsets (`?fields=id,title,status,assigned_to`) to minimize payload  
**Expansion**: Related resource embedding (`?expand=assigned_to,department`)  
**Webhooks**: Signed (HMAC-SHA256), with delivery guarantees and retry logic (exponential backoff, 72h retry window)

### 10.2 GraphQL API — Analytics & Reporting Layer

REST for CRUD operations. GraphQL for complex, multi-entity analytical queries — allowing API consumers to construct exactly the dashboard data they need in a single round-trip.

**Schema highlights**:
```graphql
type Ticket {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  status: TicketStatus!
  priority: Priority!
  assignedTo: Agent
  reporter: User!
  department: Department!
  comments(first: Int, after: String): CommentConnection!
  history: [HistoryEvent!]!
  aiInsights: TicketAIInsights!
  slaStatus: SLAStatus!
}

type TicketAIInsights {
  resolutionPrediction: ResolutionPrediction!
  sentimentScore: Float!
  similarTickets(limit: Int): [TicketSimilarity!]!
  suggestedMacros: [Macro!]!
  contextSummary: String!
}

type Query {
  ticketsByDimension(
    dimensions: [Dimension!]!,
    filters: TicketFilter,
    dateRange: DateRange!,
    groupBy: [GroupByField!],
    aggregate: [AggregateSpec!]!
  ): AnalyticsResult!
}
```

### 10.3 Native Integrations — Phase 1 Priority

**Communication**:
- **Microsoft Teams**: Bidirectional — ticket creation from Teams, notifications in Teams, status updates, agent reply via Teams message
- **Slack**: Same as Teams — native Slack App with slash commands (`/cosmitto create`, `/cosmitto status #1234`)
- **Email (SMTP/IMAP)**: Full email-to-ticket and reply-from-email workflow with HTML rendering, attachment handling

**Identity & Authentication**:
- **Microsoft Azure AD / Entra ID**: SSO via SAML 2.0 + OIDC, auto-provisioning via SCIM 2.0
- **Google Workspace**: SSO + SCIM, automatic department sync from Google Groups
- **Okta / Auth0**: SAML + OIDC, group mapping

**ITSM & DevOps**:
- **Jira**: Bidirectional ticket sync, issue linking, sprint visibility
- **GitHub / GitLab**: Link tickets to PRs/issues, auto-close tickets when linked PR merges
- **PagerDuty**: Bi-directional incident sync, alert → ticket creation, on-call escalation
- **Datadog / Grafana**: Alert → ticket creation with metric context, runbook links

**Business Systems**:
- **Salesforce**: Customer record enrichment, opportunity linkage for CX tickets, VIP detection
- **HubSpot**: Same as Salesforce for SME customers
- **ServiceNow**: Data migration and bidirectional sync (for hybrid deployments)

**Communication & Productivity**:
- **Zoom**: One-click video call from ticket context, auto-attach recording after call
- **Notion**: Bidirectional sync with runbooks and documentation
- **Confluence**: KB article sync, documentation linking

### 10.4 CosmittoHUB Marketplace

Phase 3 initiative: an integration marketplace where partners and customers can publish integrations.

- **SDK**: TypeScript-first integration SDK with local dev environment
- **Certification**: Two-tier — "Community" (self-certified) and "Verified" (Cosmitto-reviewed)
- **Revenue sharing**: 70/30 (partner/Cosmitto) for paid integrations
- **Listings**: Searchable, with install count, ratings, and reviews
- **Target at launch**: 50+ integrations (30 native, 20 community)

**Deployment frequency target**: 10+ deployments/day to production (after Phase 2)  
**Change failure rate target**: < 5%  
**Mean time to recovery target**: < 15 minutes

### 12.2 Observability Stack — The Three Pillars

**Metrics** (Prometheus + Grafana):
- Infrastructure: CPU, memory, disk, network per pod/node
- Application: request rate, error rate, latency (p50/p95/p99) per endpoint
- Business: tickets created/hour, SLA compliance rate, AI inference latency
- Custom alerts: PagerDuty escalation for P1/P2, Slack for P3/P4

**Traces** (OpenTelemetry + Jaeger):
- Distributed tracing across all services
- Every request tagged with: tenant_id, user_id, trace_id, correlation_id
- Automatic slow trace detection (> 2x p95 baseline)
- Trace sampling: 100% for errors, 10% for normal traffic, 100% for AI inference

**Logs** (Fluent Bit → Elasticsearch → Kibana):
- Structured JSON logging (no unstructured log lines)
- Log levels: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG (INFO in production)
- Sensitive data scrubbing at log emission level (PII, passwords, tokens never logged)
- Log correlation with trace IDs

**SLO Definitions**:

## Appendix B — Migration Path from v2.0 → v3.0

The migration from the current Flask monolith to the target architecture follows the **Strangler Fig pattern** — no big-bang rewrite.

**Step 1** (Week 1-2): Containerize current Flask application. Deploy behind Nginx. Add PostgreSQL (migrate from SQLite). No user-facing change.

**Step 2** (Week 3-4): Extract auth to dedicated service. Implement Redis sessions. Add structured logging. No user-facing change.

**Step 3** (Week 5-8): Add FastAPI services alongside Flask (new features go to FastAPI). Implement event bus (Redis Streams initially, Kafka in Phase 1). Begin Celery integration.

**Step 4** (Week 9-12): Migrate core ticket operations to FastAPI. Flask handles remaining routes in parallel. Full test parity required before each route migration.

**Step 5** (Month 4+): Flask fully decommissioned. All routes on FastAPI. Begin Phase 1 (AI Core) feature development.

**Database migration**:
```bash
# Zero-downtime PostgreSQL migration from SQLite
1. Deploy PostgreSQL alongside SQLite
2. Run pgloader to copy all data (< 30 seconds for current data size)
3. Enable dual-write (all writes go to both DBs)
4. Verify consistency (automated data diff)
5. Switch reads to PostgreSQL
6. Disable dual-write after 72h observation window
7. Decommission SQLite
```
